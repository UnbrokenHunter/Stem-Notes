**Euler's Formula**, discovered by [[Leonhard Euler]] around the year [[1740]], is a mathematical formula in complex analysis that establishes the fundamental relationship between the trigonometric functions and the complex exponential function. Euler's formula states that, for any real number x, one has:
$$
e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x 
$$
Where:
- $e$ is [[Euler's Number]]
- $i$ is an [[Imaginary Number]] 
- $\cos x \text{ and } \sin x$ are the Trigonometric Functions

## Euler's Identity
Euler's Identity states that when $x=\pi$, Euler's Formula bay be written as $e^{ix} + 1 = 0$, or simply: 
$$
e^{i\pi} +1 = 0
$$
