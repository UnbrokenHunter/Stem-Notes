### Harmonics
If a string is bowed, struck, or plucked in the middle, the fundamental and all odd [[Harmonic|harmonics]], which all have maximum amplitudes in the middle of the string, are emphasized; while the even harmonics, which have a [[Node]] in the center, are lacking. Exciting the string anywhere near the center produces strong lower harmonics; exciting it near the end produces strong upper harmonics. This is how the [[Harp]] is able to change its tone. 

A [[Violin]] string is bowed neat — but not too hear — one end, so that a good range of both even and odd harmonics are excited. But some will be weaker than others, for example:

> If a [[String]] is attacked approximately $\frac{1}{7}th$ its length, it will not produce the 7th harmonic. This can be an advantage because this overtone is often considered "out of tune" with the other notes being played.

### Tone Quality
The tone quality of the individual instrument within a family — e.g. [[Violin]], [[Viola]], [[Cello|'Cello]] or [[Upright Bass|Bass]] — is defined by the qualities of the [[Resonator]]; and most particularly by its size. A large resonator responds to and radiates lower notes than a small one, while the sound box of a violin is too small to radiate the fundamental of its lowest note (the low G) effectively. There is also a marked difference in the quality between the lowest notes (very rich harmonics), and the highest (strong in low and middle harmonics, but relatively thin in tone color), 
As we have seen, the point at which the string is excited emphasizes some frequencies at the expense of others; and the shape and size of the resonator modifies this still further. This characteristic of a resonator is called its [[Formant]] Formants are obviously a virtue in music, but in audio equipment they are called "an uneven frequency response" and are usually regarded as a vice.
