# Definition
A **dipole** is a system of two **equal and opposite charges or poles** separated by a distance.  
It creates an **electric** or **magnetic field** with distinct positive and negative regions. 

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Dipole is conceptual, but its measurable property — the **[[Electric Dipole Moment (p)]]** — has units of **C·m (electric)** or **A·m² (magnetic)**.

# Electric Dipoles
An **electric dipole** consists of a positive charge and an equal-sized negative [[Electric Charge (q)|Charge]] separated by a distance $\vec{d}$. It produces an [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]] with opposite directions on either side of the midpoint.

**Physical meaning:**  
A dipole represents **charge separation**, and its field falls off with distance as $1/r^3$.

**Formula:**
$$
\vec{p} = q \vec{d}
$$
Where  
- $\vec{p}$ is the **[[Electric Dipole Moment (p)|Electric Dipole Moment]]** (C·m)  
- $q$ is the **[[Electric Charge (q)|Charge]]** (C)  
- $\vec{d}$ is the **[[Displacement Vector]]** (m) pointing from negative to positive charge  

**Potential energy in a field:**
$$
U = -\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E}
$$

**Torque:**
$$
\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}
$$

# Magnetic Dipoles
A **magnetic dipole** is a loop of current or a system of atomic magnetic moments that generate a magnetic field similar in shape to that of an electric dipole.

Unlike an electric dipole, **a magnetic dipole cannot exist in isolation** — there are no confirmed **[[Magnetic Charge (g)|Magnetic Monopoles]]**.  
This principle is consistent with [[Gauss' Law for Magnetism]], which states that the divergence of $\vec{B}$ is zero — magnetic field lines are closed loops without sources or sinks.

**Formula:**
$$
\vec{m} = I \vec{A}
$$
Where  
- $\vec{m}$ is the **[[Magnetic Dipole Moment (m)|Magnetic Dipole Moment]]** (A·m²)  
- $I$ is the **[[Current]]** (A)  
- $\vec{A}$ is the **[[Area Vector]]** (m²)

**Potential energy in a field:**
$$
U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}
$$

**Torque:**
$$
\vec{\tau} = \vec{m} \times \vec{B}
$$

# Chemistry Context
In **chemistry**, the term *dipole* almost always refers to an **electric dipole** — a molecule or bond with uneven charge distribution.  
For example:
- A **bond dipole** forms when one atom attracts electrons more strongly than the other.  
- A **molecular dipole** is the vector sum of all bond dipoles.  
- Its strength is measured by the **[[Electric Dipole Moment (p)|Dipole Moment]]**, often in **debye (D)**.

Chemistry rarely uses “dipole” to mean a **magnetic dipole** except in very specific contexts (e.g., **paramagnetism**, **NMR**, **ESR**).

> [!NOTE] Summary  
> In physics: “dipole” can mean electric **or** magnetic.  
> In chemistry: “dipole” almost always means **electric**.

# Field Patterns
Both types of dipoles produce characteristic **field patterns** that fall off as $1/r^3$:
- **Electric Dipole Field:** $\vec{E} \propto \frac{1}{r^3}$  
- **Magnetic Dipole Field:** $\vec{B} \propto \frac{1}{r^3}$  

These similarities explain why many equations for electric and magnetic dipoles are structurally identical, differing only by constants and units.
