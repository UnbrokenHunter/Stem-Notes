# Definition
**Polarization** in matter describes the **alignment or displacement of [[Dipole]]** inside a material due to an external [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]]. To be polarized, is to be in a state of slightly displaced charges, creating a [[Dipole]]. Polarization itself does not have a unit, however it is often used interchangeably with the unit [[Electric Polarization Density (P)|Polarization Density]] to describe how much **charge separation** occurs per unit volume. [[Electric Polarization Density (P)|Polarization Density]] is the **average [[Electric Dipole Moment (p)|Dipole Moment]] per unit [[Volume]]**.

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Polarization itself does not have a unit. However the term often gets used interchangeably with [[Electric Polarization Density (P)|Polarization Density]] ($\vec{P}$), of units of **C/m²** — electric dipole moment per unit volume.

> [!HELP] Magnetic Analog
> Despite  [[Polarization (Matter)|Polarization]] having a distinguishment between polarization and [[Electric Polarization Density (P)|Polarization Density]], [[Magnetization (M)]], it's analog, has no such distingishment.

## Outcomes
There are **two main outcomes** of polarization, depending on the [[Material]]. 
1. Non-Polar Molecules → Induced Dipoles
	- An **Induced Dipole** is a [[Polarity|non-polar]] molecule that becomes polarized due to the presence of an [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]]. This is a temporary effect that rather weak. 
2. Polar Molecules → *Stronger* Dipoles
	- A [[Polarity|Polar]] molecule, when placed under an [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]], will align with the field easier, and will be further [[Induction|Induced]]. This creates a stronger [[Electric Dipole Moment (p)|Dipole Moment]]. 

As a result of polarization, the bound charges partially cancel the applied field inside the material. This is why [[Dielectric|dielectrics]] *reduce* the internal field. 

## Mechanisms
There are three main mechanisms by which [[Polarization (Matter)|Polarization]] can happen. 
1. Electronic Polarization
	- The [[Electron Cloud]] shifts slightly relative to the nucleus. 
		- The **negative cloud of electrons** moves a little opposite the field.
		- The **positive nucleus** moves a little in the field’s direction.
2. Ionic Polarization
	- Positive and negative [[Ionic Bond|ions]] move in opposite directions
3. Orientational Polarization
	- Permanent dipoles rotate to align with $\vec{E}$

## Formula
Polarization is defined as the **dipole moment density**:
$$
\vec{P} = \frac{\sum_i \vec{p}_i}{V}
$$
Where  
- $\vec{P}$ is the **[[Polarization (Matter)|Polarization Vector]]** (C/m²)  
- $\vec{p}_i$ is the **[[Electric Dipole Moment (p)]]** of the $i$th molecule (C·m)  
- $V$ is the **[[Volume]]** (m³)

In a **linear [[Dielectric]]**:
$$
\vec{P} = \varepsilon_0 \chi_e \vec{E}
$$
Where  
- $\varepsilon_0$ is the **[[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)|Vacuum Permittivity]]** ($8.854 \times 10^{-12}$ F/m)  
- $\chi_e$ is the **[[Electric Susceptibility (χₑ)]]** (dimensionless)  
- $\vec{E}$ is the **[[Electric Field (E)]]** (V/m)
