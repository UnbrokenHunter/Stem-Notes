# Definition
A **diamagnetic material** is one in which all [[Spin|Electron Spins]] are paired, resulting in **no permanent magnetic moment**. When exposed to a [[Magnetic Field]], it induces a **weak opposing field**, causing **[[Repulsion]]**.

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Magnetic susceptibility ($\chi_m$) is **dimensionless** and **negative** for diamagnetic materials.

**Related:**  
- [[Paramagnetic]]  
- [[Ferromagnetic]]  
- [[Magnetic Susceptibility (χm)]]  
- [[Dipole|Magnetic Dipole]]

## Formula
The induced magnetization is:
$$
\vec{M} = \chi_m \vec{H}
$$
Where  
- $\vec{M}$ is the **[[Magnetization (M)]]** (A/m)  
- $\chi_m$ is the **[[Magnetic Susceptibility (χm)|Magnetic Susceptibility]]** (dimensionless, negative for diamagnets)  
- $\vec{H}$ is the **[[Magnetic Field Intensity]]** (A/m)

For diamagnetic materials:
$$
\chi_m < 0
$$
Examples: Bi, Cu, Ag, Zn, and water.
