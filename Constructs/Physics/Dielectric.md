# Definition
A **dielectric** is an **insulating material** that can be **polarized** by an electric field.  
When a field is applied, internal dipoles align due to [[Polarization (Matter)|Polarization]], reducing the **effective [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]]** inside the material and increasing its **[[Capacitance]]**.

Whereas a [[Conductor]] would cancel an [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]] entirely, because it allows electrons to freely flow, a dielectric simply reduces it. 

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Dielectric constant ($\varepsilon_r$) is **dimensionless**, while permittivity ($\varepsilon$) is in **F/m**.

### Uses
**[[Dielectric|Dielectric]] materials** have many important uses, such as improving [[Capacitors]], [[Transistors]], and [[Cables]], by serving as [[Insulators]]. They can also be used to determine [[Refractive Index (n)|Refractive Index]]. 

**Related:**  
- [[Polarization (Matter)]]  
- [[Capacitance]]  
- [[Electric Susceptibility (χₑ)]]

## Formula
The **relative permittivity** (dielectric constant) is:
$$
\varepsilon_r = 1 + \chi_e
$$

The **electric displacement field**:
$$
\vec{D} = \varepsilon_0 \vec{E} + \vec{P}
$$
and in a homogeneous dielectric:
$$
\vec{D} = \varepsilon \vec{E} = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r \vec{E}
$$
Where  
- $\varepsilon$ is the **material permittivity** (F/m)  
- $\varepsilon_0$ is the **vacuum permittivity**  
- $\varepsilon_r$ is the **relative permittivity**  
- $\vec{E}$ is the **electric field**  
- $\vec{P}$ is the **polarization**
