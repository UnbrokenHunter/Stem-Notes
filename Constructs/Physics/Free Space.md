# Definition
**Free space** refers to a perfect [[Vacuum]] — a region with **no matter or charges**, where electromagnetic waves propagate **without absorption or dispersion**. It forms the baseline environment for defining [[Constants]] like [[Magnetic Permeability of Free Space (μ0)]] and [[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)]].

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Free space itself has no units; associated constants (like $\varepsilon_0$ and $\mu_0$) do.

**Related:**  
- [[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)|Vacuum Permittivity]]  
- [[Magnetic Permeability of Free Space (μ0)]]  
- [[Speed of Light (c)]]  
- [[Wave Impedance of Free Space (Z₀)]]

## Formula
Electromagnetic relations in free space:
$$
c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0}}
$$
$$
Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\varepsilon_0}}
$$
and
$$
k_0 = \frac{\omega}{c}
$$
