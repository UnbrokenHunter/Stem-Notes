# Definition
**Flux** represents the **total flow of a vector field through a surface**.  
It quantifies how much of something (like an electric or magnetic field) passes through a given area.

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Flux depends on the type of field:  
> - Electric flux → volt·meters (V·m)  
> - Magnetic flux → webers (Wb)

# Mathematical Form
Flux through a surface $S$ is given by:
$$
\Phi = \iint_S \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{A}
$$
Where  
- $\Phi$ is the **Flux**  
- $\vec{F}$ is the **Vector Field** (e.g., $\vec{E}$ or $\vec{B}$)  
- $d\vec{A}$ is the **infinitesimal area vector**, normal to the surface  

The **dot product** means only the component of the field *perpendicular* to the surface contributes to flux.

# Physical Meaning
Flux measures how strongly a field “pierces” or “flows through” a surface.  
- **High flux** → field lines concentrated through the surface  
- **Zero flux** → field lines tangent or balanced (equal entering and leaving)

> [!EXAMPLE]
> For a closed surface:
> - Positive flux → more field lines exiting than entering  
> - Negative flux → more entering than exiting
