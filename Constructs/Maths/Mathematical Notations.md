## Calculus Notations
> In differential calculus, there is no single standard notation for differentiation. Instead, several notations for the derivative of a function or a dependent variable have been proposed by various mathematicians, including Leibniz, Newton, Lagrange, and Arbogast. The usefulness of each notation depends on the context in which it is used, and it is sometimes advantageous to use more than one notation in a given context. 
 
### Leibnitz
The original notation employed by **Gottfried Leibniz** is used throughout mathematics. It is particularly common when the equation $y = f(x)$ is regarded as a functional relationship between the dependent and independent variables $y$ and $x$.  

Leibniz's notation makes this relationship explicit by writing the derivative as:  
$$\frac{dy}{dx}$$
Furthermore, the derivative of $f$ at $x$ is therefore written as:  
$$\frac{df}{dx}(x) \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{df(x)}{dx} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{d}{dx}f(x)$$

> $$\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}, \quad \frac{d^{3}y}{dx^{3}}, \quad \frac{d^{4}y}{dx^{4}}, \ldots, \frac{d^{n}y}{dx^{n}}$$

### Lagrange
In Lagrange's notation, a prime mark denotes a derivative â€“ hence it is sometimes called prime notation. If f is a function, then its derivative evaluated at x is written 
$$f'(x)$$
> [!NOTE] Higher Order Derivatives
> Higher derivatives are indicated using additional prime marks, as in $f''(x)$ for the second derivative and $f'''(x)$ for the third derivative.
