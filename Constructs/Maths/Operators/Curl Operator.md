# Definition
Similar to [[Divergence Operator|Divergence]], the **Curl** is an operator that works on [[Vector Field|Vector Fields]]. It is often represented by the times symbol ($\times$), however, it is sometimes shown like a function, writing $curl(E)$. It is easiest to imagine them in terms of fluid flow. In this context, the curl tells you how much an imagined fluid tends to rotate around a point. You could imagine a twig being dropped at a point in water. The curl would tell you how much the twig tended to rotate around itself.

Regions where that rotation is clockwise are said to have positive curl, and anticlockwise is said to have negative curl.

It is also not the case that fluid has to be going in opposite directions for a non-zero curl. Situations similar to [[Sheer]] would also cause "rotation," and therefor have a non-zero curl.
