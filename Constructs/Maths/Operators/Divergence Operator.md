# Definition
Similar to [[Curl Operator|Curl]], the **Divergence** is an operator that works on [[Vector Field|Vector Fields]]. It is often represented by a dot ( $\cdot$ ), however sometimes it is shown like a function, writing $div(E)$. It is easiest to imagine them in terms of fluid flow. In this context, the divergence tells you how much an imagined fluid tends to flow "out of" or "into" a point.

A positive number would indicate that it is a "source," or that liquid is flowing out of it faster than it flows in. A negative number indicates that it is a "sink" and and liquid is flowing into it it faster than it flows out. 

It also does not have to be the case that fluid is flowing into or out of it from every direction. It would also be positive if the fluid coming into it is just moving slower than the fluid coming out of it in another direction, as that would still insinuate a sort of spontaneous generation.

### In Short
> The [[Divergence Operator]] takes in a vector and returns a single number, measuring how much that point acts as a source or a sink. 

## Uses
The Divergence is very useful outside of fluid flow, however. One particularly useful application is it's use in [[Electromagnetism]]. [[Maxwell's Equations]], the equations that describe how [[Electric Field (E)|Electric]] and [[Magnetic Field|Magnetic]] Fields operate, are written in the language of [[Divergence Operator|Divergence]] and [[Curl Operator|Curl]].
