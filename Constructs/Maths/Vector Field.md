# Definition
A **Vector Field** is a graph that represents each point in space as a [[Vector]], showing its magnitude and direction. They are useful for things like [[Fluid Dynamics]] and [[Electromagnetism]], as they allow you to show how forces change over an area. 

In a sense, a [[Vector Field]] is just a way to represent a function that returns multiple variables.
