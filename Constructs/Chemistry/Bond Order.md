> Bond orderÂ ==quantifies the number of chemical bonds between two atoms, calculated as half the difference between bonding and antibonding electrons in a molecule's molecular orbitals==

$$
B = \frac{E_{Bonding} - {E_{Antibonding}}}{2}
$$
Where B is the Bond Order. 

You can determine the number of bonding and antibonding electrons using an [[Molecular Orbital Diagram|MO Diagram]].
