# Molecular Orbital Diagram
A molecular orbital (MO) diagram is ==a visual representation that shows the energy levels of molecular orbitals (MOs) formed when atomic orbitals (AOs) of atoms combine to form a molecule==. It places the atomic orbitals of the constituent atoms on the sides and the resulting molecular orbitals in the center, showing how electrons fill from lowest energy to highest, with bonding orbitals being more stable (lower energy) and anti-bonding orbitals being less stable (higher energy). The diagram helps predict a molecule's properties, such as its bond order and magnetic properties.

## Two Variations
There are **two versions** of the molecular orbital (MO) diagram for homonuclear diatomic molecules. The one above is the "Normal" one. 
### A. “Flipped” diagram (σ2p < π2p)

Used for:

> **B₂, C₂, N₂**

### B. “Normal” diagram (σ2p > π2p)

Used for:

> **O₂, F₂, Ne₂**

> [!NOTE] Memory Trick
> > **“B–C–N mix, O–F fix.”**  
> > (B₂, C₂, N₂ → mixed / flipped diagram; O₂, F₂ → fixed / normal diagram)
