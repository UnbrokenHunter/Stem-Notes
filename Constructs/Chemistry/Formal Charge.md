## Definition
> Formal charge isÂ ==the hypothetical charge an atom would have if all electrons in a chemical bond were shared equally==

It is commonly used for checking [[Lewis Diagrams]] and comparing [[Resonance Structures]]
## Formula
$$
FC = V_{e} - (D + B)
$$
*Where* 
- *FC* is Formal Charge 
- *V<sub>e</sub>* is the number of Valence Electrons
- *D* is the number of Dots (In the Lewis Structure)
- *B* is the number of Bonds
