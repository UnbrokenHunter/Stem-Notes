# In Physics
**In physics**, the term "*light*" may refer more broadly to [[Electromagnetic Radiation]] of any [[Wavelength (λ)|Wavelength]], whether visible or not. In this sense, [[Gamma Rays]], [[X-rays]], [[Microwaves]] and [[Radio Waves]] are also light. The primary properties of light are [[Intensity (Light)]], propagation direction, [[Frequency (ƒ)|Frequency]] or [[Wavelength (λ)|Wavelength]], and [[Polarization (Light)|Polarization]]. Its [[Speed of Light (c)|speed]] in vacuum, 299792458 m/s, is one of the [[Constant|Fundamental Constants]] of nature. All electromagnetic radiation exhibits some properties of both particles and waves. Single, massless [[Elementary Particles]], or [[Quanta]], of light called [[Photons]] can be detected with specialized equipment; phenomena like [[Interference]] are described by waves.
