The air column inside a wind instrument may be excited by the [[Vibration|Vibrations]] in turbulent air at the edge of an orifice (as in a [[Flute]]), by one or two [[Reed|Reeds]] in the mouthpiece ([[Clarinet]], [[Oboe]]) or by the player's lips ([[Brass]]). The note that is produced depends on the dimensions of the [[Resonator]] itself, and on the formation of [[Standing Waves]] within it. 

The progressive waves of radiating sound are converted into stationary waves by [[Reflection]] at a boundary. At a solid, rigid surface there can be no air movement perpendicular to it: 

> [!QUOTE] The incident and reflected waves add together in such a way that air displacement at the wall is always zero. 

This is called a [[Node]] in the standing wave: there will be further nodes at the first, second, and each successive complete wavelengths from the wall; while at the intervening half wavelengths there will be antinodes, places where there is a maximum aid displacement.
