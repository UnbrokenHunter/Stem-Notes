The air column inside a wind instrument may be excited by the [[Vibration|Vibrations]] in turbulent air at the edge of an orifice (as in a [[Flute]]), by one or two [[Reed|Reeds]] in the mouthpiece ([[Clarinet]], [[Oboe]]) or by the player's lips ([[Brass]]). The note that is produced depends on the dimensions of the [[Resonator]] itself, and on the formation of [[Standing Waves]] within it. 

The progressive waves of radiating sound are converted into stationary waves by [[Reflection]] at a boundary. At a solid, rigid surface there can be no air movement perpendicular to it: 

> [!QUOTE] The incident and reflected waves add together in such a way that air displacement at the wall is always zero. 

This is called a [[Node]] in the standing wave: there will be further nodes at the first, second, and each successive complete wavelengths from the wall; while at the intervening half wavelengths there will be antinodes, places where there is a maximum aid displacement. 

### Behavior of [[Standing Waves]]
In practice, not all of the wave is [[Reflection|Reflected]]: the surface [[Absorption|Absorbs]] some of the sound, and transmits some through to the other side, but in the aid column of a wind instrument the standing wave dominates the pattern. In fact, one or both ends of the air column of a musical instrument may be open, but reflections still occur because the pipe is narrow compared with the wavelength of most of the sound in the column : the air pipe forms a piston which is simply not big enough to drive the outside air efficiently. In this case, the energy has to go somewhere : it is reflected repeatedly back along the column, building up a powerful standing wave, whose pitch is defined by the length of the column. 

### Harmonics in an Air Column
Some instruments have air columns that are open at one end; some are effectively open at both. A column that is open (or closed) at both ends has a fundamental wavelength which is twice the length of the pipe, and produces a full harmonic series. An air column that is open at one end and closed at the other behaves differently : the fundamental is four times its length, and only the odd harmonics are produced. 

In orchestral instruments the length of the column may be varied continuously (as in the [[Tombone| Slide Trombone]]), by adding discrete extra lengths ([[Trumpet]] and [[French Horn]]) or by opening and closing holes in the body of the instrument ([[Woodwind]]). The [[Formant]] of the instrument depends on the shape of the body and bell (the open end).
