# Definition
The spring constant $k$ measures a spring's stiffness and is defined as the force needed to stretch or compress it by a unit of distance. 

## Formula
In Series:
$$
\frac{1}{k_{eq}}=\frac{1}{k_{1}}+\frac{1}{k_{2}}+\dots
$$
Where:
- $k_{eq}$ is the Equivalent [[Spring Constant (k)|Spring Constant]]
- $k_{1} \text{ and } k_{2}$ are the Individual [[Spring Constant (k)|Spring Constant]]

In Parallel:
$$
k_{eq}=k_{1}+k_{2}+\dots
$$
Where:
- $k_{eq}$ is the Equivalent [[Spring Constant (k)|Spring Constant]]
- $k_{1} \text{ and } k_{2}$ are the Individual [[Spring Constant (k)|Spring Constant]]
