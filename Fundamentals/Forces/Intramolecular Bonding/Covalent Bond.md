# Covalent Bonds
**Covalent Bonds** are typically formed between two nonmetals, and have shared electrons, rather than a full transfer. They can be [[Polarity|Polar]] or nonpolar, depending on whether the electrons are shared equally. 

> [!NOTE] Physical State
> If a covalent bond is nonpolar, and therefor only has [[London Dispersion Forces|Dispersion Forces]], then it is likely a gas or liquid at room temperature. If has dipole-dipole bonding, it is usually still weak and therefore a gas, unless it has [[Hydrogen Bond|Hydrogen Bonding]]. FIX LATER THIS IS WRONG

The **Bond Length** is determined by the point of minimum potential energy between two particles. The energy at the ideal bond length will always be less than then the starting energy, which is why forming a bond is always an [[Exothermic]] reaction. The energy released by the bond when it is broken is also equal to the distance between the starting energy and the minimum.

## Sigma Bonds
**Sigma Bonds** involve direct orbital overlap, be it between two atomic orbitals or two hybrid orbitals. **They can sometimes be between an atomic orbital and a hybrid orbital**. 
## Pi Bonds
****
**Pi Bonds** involve lateral overlap between unhybridized p orbitals.
