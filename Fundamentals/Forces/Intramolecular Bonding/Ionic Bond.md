# Ionic Bonds
**Ionic Bonds** are formed between opposite ions, being an anion and a cation. The valence electrons are completely transferred. They usually form between a metal and a nonmetal, **however they can also form between polyatomic ions, even if the atoms inside of it are metals or nonmetals.**

> [!NOTE] Physical State
> Ionic Compounds are almost always solids at room temperature

The melting point of Ionic Compounds is determined by its [[Ion Lattice|Lattice Energy]]. 
> - As Charge increases, Lattice Energy Increases
> - As Atom Size Increases, Lattice Energy Decreases
