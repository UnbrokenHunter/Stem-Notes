# Hydrogen Bonding

> A **special type of strong dipole–dipole attraction** that occurs **only between certain molecules**. It is the strongest type of Intermolecular Force (IMF)

> [!Note!] 
> Hydrogen Bonds, due to their large Intermolecular Forces, often greatly increase Boiling Point, Viscosity, Surface Tension, and decrease Evaporation Rate
## Formation Conditions

### 1. Hydrogen donor
- Hydrogen is **covalently bonded** to a **highly electronegative atom** — **N, O, or F**  
  → the hydrogen becomes **strongly δ⁺ (partially positive)**

### 2. Hydrogen acceptor
- Another molecule (or part of the same molecule) has a **lone pair** on **N, O, or F**

**Both** conditions must be met for hydrogen bonding to occur.

## When Hydrogen Bonding Happens

| Donor bond | Acceptor atom with lone pair | Example   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | --------- |
| H–F        | F, O, or N                   | HF···HF   |
| H–O        | F, O, or N                   | H₂O···H₂O |
| H–N        | F, O, or N                   | NH₃···NH₃ |

## When It Does *Not* Apply

- The hydrogen is bonded to a **less electronegative atom** (e.g., **C–H** in CH₄) → **no hydrogen bonding**
- The molecule with H–O or H–N has **nothing to bond with** — the other molecule has **no N, O, or F lone pairs**

> [!NOTE] London Forces
> If two different molecules have the same hydrogen bonds, the one with the greater molar mass has the higher IMF, due to [[London Dispersion Forces]]

### Solubility
The smaller the non-polar region inside a molecule, the greater its solubility

## Summary

**Requires both:**
1. **H–N, H–O, or H–F bond**
2. **Lone pair on N, O, or F**

→ **Strong intermolecular attraction** that explains:
- High boiling points (e.g., H₂O, HF, NH₃)
- Surface tension
- DNA base pairing
