# Lattice Energy

Lattice Energy is the energy released when an **Ionic Compound** is formed. It is dependent on the charges of the Ions, and the distance between them.$$LE=\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{R}$$Where Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub> are the charges of each Ion, and R is the distance between them. 

> **This means that:** 
> - As Charge increases, Lattice Energy Increases
> - As Atom Size Increases, Lattice Energy Decreases

# Structure
## Simple Lattice 
A simple lattice is a cubic structure that is adopted by Polonium.

## Simple Cubic Structure
Ionic Compounds often form this structure, where an ion forms a cubic structure, and the other ion fills in the holes in-between.
