**Intermolecular Forces** (IMFs) are a type of force that operates in-between molecules. The strength of IMFs will determine a [[Covalent Bond]]'s Boiling Point, Viscosity, Surface Tension, and Evaporation Rate. Broadly speaking, 

> Higher IMFs, **Higher Boiling Point**
> Higher IMFs, **Higher Viscosity**
> Higher IMFs, **Higher Surface Tension**
> Higher IMFs, **Lower Evaporation Rate**

> [!NOTE] For Ionic Compounds
> Ionic Compounds are held together by [[Electrostatic Attraction]], leading to [[Ion Lattice|Lattice Structure]]s. Their properties are not based on Intermolecular Forces, but instead, on it's Lattice Energy.
