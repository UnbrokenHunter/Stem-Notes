# Definition
**Electronegativity** measures an atom’s **tendency to attract electrons** in a chemical bond. It reflects how strongly an atom pulls shared electrons toward itself in a molecule, influencing **bond polarity**, **molecular geometry**, and **reactivity**. Common scales include the **[[Pauling Scale]]**, **[[Mulliken Electronegativity]]**, and **[[Allred–Rochow Electronegativity]]**.

**Related:**
- [[Bond Polarity]] — difference in electronegativity determines partial charge distribution
- [[Electric Dipole Moment (p)]] — proportional to charge separation and bond length
- [[Periodic Trends]] — electronegativity increases across a period and decreases down a group
## Notable Electronegativities include:

| Hydrogen     | ~2.0 |
| ------------ | ---- |
| **Boron**    | ~2.0 |
| **Carbon**   | ~2.5 |
| **Nitrogen** | ~3.0 |
| **Oxygen**   | ~3.5 |
| **Florine**  | ~4.0 |
## Formula
> [!tip] Unit!  
> **Electronegativity is dimensionless** — it’s a relative measure, not a directly measurable physical quantity.

### 1. Qualitative Trend

> #### Across a period: ↑ Down a group: ↓

> Electronegativity increases left → right (nuclear charge rises) and decreases top → bottom (atomic radius grows).

### 2. Mulliken Definition
$$
\chi=\frac{I+A}{2}
$$
Where:
- $\chi$ is the **electronegativity** (dimensionless)
- $I$ is the **[[Ionization Energy (I)]]** (energy required to remove an electron, usually in eV)
- $A$ is the **[[Electron Affinity (A)]]** (energy released when gaining an electron, eV)
This connects electronegativity to measurable atomic properties.  
Atoms with high $I$ and high $A$ both strongly resist losing and strongly attract electrons — meaning high $\chi$.
