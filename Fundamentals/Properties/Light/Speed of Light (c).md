# Definition 
> The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is a universal physical [[Constant]] exactly equal to 299,792,458 meters per second (approximately 1 billion kilometers per hour; 700 million miles per hour). It is exact because, by international agreement, a meter is defined as the length of the path travelled by [[Light]] in vacuum during a time interval of $\frac{1}{299,792458}$ second. The speed of light is the same for all observers, no matter their relative velocity. It is the upper limit for the speed at which information, matter, or energy can travel through space.
