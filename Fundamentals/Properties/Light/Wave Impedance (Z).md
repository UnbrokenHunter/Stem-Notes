# Definition
**Wave impedance** ($Z$) defines the ratio of the **[[Electric Field (E)]]** to the **[[Magnetic Field (H)]]** in an [[Electromagnetic Wave]]. It describes how the wave propagates through a medium and determines **[[Reflection]]** and **[[Transmission]]** at boundaries.

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Wave impedance is measured in **ohms (Ω)**.

**Related:**  
- [[Electric Field (E)]]  
- [[Magnetic Field (H)]]  
- [[Refractive Index (n)]]  
- [[Wave Impedance of Free Space (Z₀)]]

## Formula
$$
Z = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\varepsilon}}
$$
Where  
- $\mu$ is the **[[Magnetic Permeability (μ)|Magnetic Permeability]]** (H/m)  
- $\varepsilon$ is the **[[Electric Permittivity (ε)|Permittivity]]** (F/m)

Also expressed as:
$$
Z = \frac{E}{H}
$$
