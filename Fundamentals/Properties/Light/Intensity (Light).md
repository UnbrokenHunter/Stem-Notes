# Definition
**In physics** and many other areas of science and engineering the **intensity** or **flux of radiant energy** is the power transferred per unit area, where the area is measured on the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the energy. In the SI system, **it has units watts per square meter ($\frac{W}{m^2}$), or $kg \cdot s^{-3}$ in base units.**
