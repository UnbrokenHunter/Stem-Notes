> An **exothermic** process is ==one that releases energy into its surroundings, usually in the form of heat, but sometimes as light, electricity, or sound==
## Examples
- **Combustion:** The burning of any substance is exothermic, releasing heat and light.
- **Freezing:** When a liquid turns into a solid, it releases heat.
- **Hand warmers:** These devices use exothermic chemical reactions to generate heat.
