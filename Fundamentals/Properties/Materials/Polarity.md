# Definition
**Polarity** is ==a measure of a separation of electric charge, resulting in a molecule or system having a negative and a positive end==. It arises from an **unequal distribution of [[Electron Density]]** between atoms within a [[Molecule]]. 

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Polarity is **dimensionless** — it’s a qualitative property describing charge imbalance.

Polarity specifically arises from an unequal sharing of an [[Electron]] within a [[Covalent Bond]]. **It is possible to have polar bonds, and still be a non-polar molecule**. This would happen in a case where multiple polar bonds are placed placed symmetrically around a molecule, and so the total polarity cancels out.

In this case, you can distinguish between individual bonds being polar, and therefor having an unequal distribution of charge, from polarity in a molecule which would imply a net [[Dipole|Dipole]] across the entirety of the [[Material]].

# In Chemistry
The polarity of an atom or molecule describes the **balance of charge** around it.  
To determine polarity, you must:
1. Identify the **molecular geometry**
2. Compare the **electronegativities** of bonded atoms  

If the **electronegativity difference** is greater than 0.4:
$$
\Delta EN > 0.4 \implies \text{Polar bond}
$$
Otherwise:
$$
\Delta EN \le 0.4 \implies \text{Nonpolar bond}
$$

## Quick Notes
- Any atom paired with itself (e.g. N₂, Cl₂, H₂) or noble gases (He, Ne, Xe) are ==non-polar==.  
- Molecules with only C and H (hydrocarbons) are ==non-polar==.  
- If a molecule exhibits [[Hydrogen Bonding]], it is ==polar==.  
  - Examples: H₂O, NH₃, HF, CH₃OH  
- Lack of **symmetry** in a polar bond distribution → ==polar molecule==  
  - Example: S=C=O (EN 2.5, 2.5, 3.5)
