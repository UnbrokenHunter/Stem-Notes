# Definition
The **damping rate** ($\gamma$) quantifies how quickly oscillations or waves lose amplitude due to **energy dissipation**. It’s used in models like the [[Lorentz Oscillator Model]] and in describing **[[Absorption Coefficient (α)|Wave Attenuation]]**.

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Damping rate is measured in **s⁻¹** (reciprocal seconds).

**Related:**  
- [[Lorentz Oscillator Model]]  
- [[Resonance Frequency (ω₀)]]  
- [[Complex Electric Permittivity (ε̃)]]  
- [[Absorption Coefficient (α)|Absorption Coefficient]]

## Formula
For a damped oscillator:
$$
m \ddot{x} + m \gamma \dot{x} + kx = 0
$$

Amplitude decays as:
$$
A(t) = A_0 e^{-\frac{\gamma t}{2}}
$$

In frequency response:
$$
\tilde{\omega} = \omega_0 - i \frac{\gamma}{2}
$$
Where  
- $\gamma$ is the **[[Damping Rate (γ)|Damping Rate]]** (s⁻¹)  
- $\omega_0$ is the **[[Angular Frequency (ω)#Natural Angular Frequency|Natural Angular Frequency]]** (rad/s)
