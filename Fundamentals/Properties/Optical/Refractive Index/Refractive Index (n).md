# Refractive Index (Real Part)
The Refractive Index of an optical medium is the ratio of the apparent [[Speed of Light (c)]] in the air or [[Vacuum]] to the speed in the medium. The refractive index determines how much the path of [[Light]] is bent, or refracted, when entering a [[Material]]. This is described by [[Snell's Law of Refraction]]: $$n_{1} sin(\theta_{1}) = n_{2} sin(\theta_{2})$$Where $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$ are the angle of incidence and angle of refraction, respectively, of a [[Ray]] crossing the interface between two media with refractive indices $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$. The refractive indices also determine the amount of light that is [[Reflection|reflected]] when reaching the interface, as well as the critical angle for [[Total Internal Reflection]], their [[Intensity]] ([[Fresnel Equations]]) and [[Brewster's Angle]].
