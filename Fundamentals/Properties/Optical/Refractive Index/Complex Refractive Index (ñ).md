# Complex Refractive Index 
When light passes through a medium, some part of it will always be absorbed. This can be conveniently taken into account by defining a complex refractive index (ñ). 

The real and imaginary parts of this refractive index are not independent, and are connected through the [[Kramers–Kronig Relations]], i.e. the complex refractive index is a linear response function, ensuring [[Causality]]. Here, the real part n is the refractive index and indicates the [[Phase Velocity]], while the imaginary part κ is called the [[Extinction Coefficient (κ)|Extinction Coefficient]]: indicates the amount of attenuation when the [[Electromagnetic Wave]] propagates through the [[Material]].  
## Formula 
$$
\underline{n} = n-i\kappa
$$
Where 
- $\underline{n}$ (often **ñ**) is the [[Complex Refractive Index (ñ)|Complex Refractive Index]]
- $n$ is the [[Refractive Index (n)|Refractive Index]]
- $\kappa$ is the [[Extinction Coefficient (κ)|Extinction Coefficient]]
