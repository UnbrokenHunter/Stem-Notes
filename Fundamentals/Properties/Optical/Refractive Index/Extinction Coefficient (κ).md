# Definition
The **Extinction coefficient** is the imaginary part of [[Complex Refractive Index (ñ)]]. It accounts for both [[Absorption]] and [[Scattering]], and represents the loss of wave energy as light passes through a medium.

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> The **Extinction Coefficient** is **dimensionless! ** 

## Formula
The **[[Extinction Coefficient (κ)|Extinction Coefficient]]** is related to [[Absorption Coefficient (α)]] via:
$$
\alpha_{abs}(\omega)=\frac{2\omega \kappa(\omega)}{c}
$$
Where
- $\alpha_{abs}$ is the [[Absorption Coefficient (α)|Absorption Coefficient]]
- $\omega$ is the [[Angular Frequency (ω)|Angular Frequency]] 
- $\kappa$ is the Extinction Coefficient
- $c$ is the [[Speed of Light (c)]]

It can also be written as such:
$$
\alpha_{abs}=\frac{4\pi\kappa}{\lambda}
$$
Where
- $\alpha_{abs}$ is the [[Absorption Coefficient (α)|Absorption Coefficient]]
- $\kappa$ is the Extinction Coefficient
- $\lambda$ is the [[Wavelength (λ)|Wavelength]]
