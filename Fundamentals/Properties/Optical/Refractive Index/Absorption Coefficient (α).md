# Definition
The **Absorption coefficient** characterizes how easily a volume of [[Material]] can be penetrated by a beam of [[Light]], [[Sound]], [[Particles]], or other [[Energy]] or [[Matter]]. A coefficient value that is large represents a beam becoming 'attenuated' as it passes through a given medium, while a small value represents that the medium had little effect on loss. 

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> The **Absorption Coefficient** has units of  $m^{-1}$.
