# Definition
The **elementary charge**, usually denoted by $e$, is a fundamental physical [[Constant]], defined as the [[Electric Charge (q)|Electric Charge]] carried by a single [[Proton]] (+1 e) or, equivalently, the magnitude of the negative electric charge carried by a single [[Electron]], which has charge $−1 e$.

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> In SI units, the [[Coulomb]] is defined such that the value of the elementary charge is exactly $e = 1.602176634×10{−19} C$ or $160.2176634$ zeptocoulombs ($zC$).

Particles called [[Quarks]] have smaller charges, multiples of ⁠$\frac{1}{3}e$, but they are found only combined in particles that have a charge that is an integer multiple of e. In the [[Standard Model]], charge is an absolutely conserved quantum number. The proton has a charge of +e, and the electron has a charge of −e.


> [!HELP] Magnetic Analog
> Due to the current lack of evidence for [[Magnetic Charge (g)|Magnetic Monopoles]], there is not a real magnetic analog for the [[Elementary Electric Charge (e)|Elementary Charge]], however, there have been theoretical proposals of such a unit, namely the [[Elementary Magnetic Charge (gD)|Elementary Magnetic Charge]], proposed by [[Paul Dirac]].
