# Definition
The [[Electric Susceptibility (χₑ)]] is a dimensionless proportionality constant that indicates the degree of [[Polarization (Matter)|Polarization]] of a [[Dielectric]] material in response to an applied [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]]. The greater the electric susceptibility, the greater the ability of a material to polarize in response to the field, and thereby reduce the total electric field inside the material (and store energy). It is in this way that the electric susceptibility influences the [[Electric Permittivity (ε)|Electric Permittivity]] of the material and thus influences many other phenomena in that medium, from the [[Capacitance]] of capacitors to the [[Speed of Light (c)|Speed of Light]].

## Formula
The most general formula for [[Electric Susceptibility (χₑ)]] is as follows: 
$$
\chi_{e} \equiv \frac{1}{\epsilon_{0}}\frac{\partial \vec{P}}{\partial \vec{E}}
$$
Where
- $\chi_{e}$ is the [[Electric Susceptibility (χₑ)]]
- $\epsilon_{0}$ is the [[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)]] 
- $\vec{P}$ is the **[[Electric Polarization Density (P)|Polarization Density]]** — [[Electric Dipole Moment (p)|Dipole Moment]] per unit [[Volume]] (C/m²)
- $\vec{E}$ is the [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field Magnitude]] (V/m)
- $\frac{\partial \vec{P}}{\partial \vec{E}}$ is the rate of change of [[Electric Polarization Density (P)|Polarization Density]] with respect to the [[Electric Field (E)]]

However the following formula is often preferred. It assumes that $\chi_e$ is constant — valid for most materials under weak fields.
$$
\vec{P} =\epsilon_{0} \chi \vec{E}
$$
Where:
- $\vec{P}$ is the **[[Electric Polarization Density (P)|Polarization Density]]** — [[Electric Dipole Moment (p)|Dipole Moment]] per unit [[Volume]] (C/m²)
- $\varepsilon_0$ is the **[[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)|Vacuum Permittivity]]** ($8.854\times10^{-12}$ F/m)
- $\chi_e$ is the **[[Electric Susceptibility (χₑ)|Electric Susceptibility]]** (dimensionless)
- $\vec{E}$ is the **[[Electric Field (E)]]** (V/m)
