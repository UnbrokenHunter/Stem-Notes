In physics, the electric displacement field (denoted by D), also called electric flux density, is a vector field that appears in [[Maxwell's Equations]]. It accounts for the electromagnetic effects of [[Polarization (Light)|Polarization]] and that of an [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]], combining the two in an auxiliary field. It plays a major role in the physics of phenomena such as the [[Capacitance]] of a [[Material]], the response of [[Dielectric|Dielectrics]] to an electric field, how shapes can change due to electric fields in [[Piezoelectricity]] or [[Flexoelectricity]] as well as the creation of voltages and charge transfer due to elastic strains.

## Formula
The electric displacement field $D$ is defined as:
$$
\vec{D} \equiv \varepsilon_{0}\vec{E} + \vec{P}
$$
Where:
- $\vec{D}$ is the [[Electric Displacement Field (D)|Electric Displacement Field]]
- $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the [[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (Îµ0)]]
- $\vec{E}$ is the [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]] 
- $\vec{P}$ is the (macroscopic) density of the permanent and induced electric dipole moments in the material, called the [[Electric Polarization Density (P)|Polarization Density]]
