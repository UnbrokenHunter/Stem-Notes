# Definition
In classical electromagnetism, polarization density (or electric polarization, or simply polarization) is the [[Vector Field]] that expresses the volumetric [[Density]] of permanent or [[Polarization (Matter)#Outcomes|induced]] [[Electric Dipole Moment (p)|Electric Dipole Moments]] in a [[Dielectric]] material. When a dielectric is placed in an external [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]], its molecules gain electric dipole moment and the dielectric is said to be [[Polarization (Matter)|polarized]].

## Formula
$$
P=\frac{dp}{dV}
$$
Where
- $P$ is the [[Electric Polarization Density (P)|Polarization Density]] (C/m²)
- $dp$ is the infinitesimal [[Electric Dipole Moment (p)]]
- $dV$ is the infinitesimal [[Volume]]

Or the more common [[Summation]] notation:
$$
\vec{P} = \frac{\sum_i \vec{p}_i}{V}
$$
Where  
- $\vec{P}$ is the **[[Electric Polarization Density (P)|Polarization Density]]** (C/m²)  
- $\vec{p}_i$ is the **[[Electric Dipole Moment (p)|Dipole Moment]]** of the $i$th molecule (C·m)  
- $V$ is the **[[Volume]]** (m³)

In a **linear [[Dielectric]]**:
$$
\vec{P} = \varepsilon_0 \chi_e \vec{E}
$$
Where  
-  $\vec{P}$ is the **[[Electric Polarization Density (P)|Polarization Density]]** (C/m²)  
- $\varepsilon_0$ is the **[[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)|Vacuum Permittivity]]** ($8.854 \times 10^{-12}$ F/m)  
- $\chi_e$ is the **[[Electric Susceptibility (χₑ)]]** (dimensionless)  
- $\vec{E}$ is the **[[Electric Field (E)]]** (V/m)


The net charge appearing as a result of polarization is called bound charge and denoted $Q_{b}$. This definition of polarization density as a "dipole moment per unit volume" is widely adopted, though in some cases it can lead to ambiguities and paradoxes.
