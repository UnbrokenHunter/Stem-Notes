# Definition
**Relative Permittivity** ($\varepsilon_r$) — also known as the **Dielectric Constant** — is the ratio of a material’s [[Electric Permittivity (ε)|Permittivity]] to that of free space ($\varepsilon_0$):

$$
\varepsilon_r = \frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_0} = 1 + \chi_e
$$

It expresses how much the electric field is reduced inside a material compared to in a vacuum.

> [!HELP] Magnetic Analog  
> The magnetic analog of relative permittivity is [[Relative Magnetic Permeability (μr)|Relative Magnetic Permeability]].

> [!NOTE] Unit!  
> Relative permittivity is **dimensionless**.
