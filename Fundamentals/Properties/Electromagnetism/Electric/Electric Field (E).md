# Definition
An **electric field** describes how a charged object affects the space around it — specifically, how it exerts a **force** on other electric [[Electric Charge (q)|Charges]]. 

It’s a **[[Vector Field]]**, meaning every point in space has both:
- a **magnitude** (how strong the field is), and
- a **direction** (the direction a positive charge would move if placed there).

> [!HELP] Magnetic Analog
> It is the electric analog of [[Magnetic Field (H)|Magnetic H-Fields]]. 

## Formula
$$
\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q}=\frac{d\vec{F}}{dq}
$$
Where:
- $\vec{E}$ is the [[Electric Field (E)]] (N/C or V/m)
- $\vec{F}$ is the [[Force]] on a small positive test charge
- $q$ is the Magnitude of that test [[Electric Charge (q)|Charge]]]

So $\vec{E}$ tells you the force per unit charge.
