# Definition
**Volume charge density** ($\rho$) measures the **amount of [[Electric Charge (q)]] per unit volume** at a given point in space. It is a fundamental quantity in [[Gauss' Law for Electricity|Gauss' Law]] and [[Poisson’s Equation]].

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Volume charge density has units of **C/m³ (coulombs per cubic meter)**.

> [!HELP] Magnetic Analog
> Due to the non-existence of a [[Magnetic Charge (g)|Magnetic Monopole]], there is no direct analog to [[Volume Charge Density (ρ)|Volume Charge Density]].

## Formula
$$
\rho = \frac{dq}{dV}
$$
Where  
- $\rho$ is the **[[Volume Charge Density (ρ)|Volume Charge Density]]** (C/m³)  
- $dq$ is the **[[Electric Charge (q)]]** in the volume element $dV$ (C)  
- $dV$ is the **infinitesimal volume** (m³)

In differential form of Gauss’s law:
$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
$$
