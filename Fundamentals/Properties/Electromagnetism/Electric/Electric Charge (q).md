# Definition
Electric charge (q, sometimes Q) is a physical property of [[Matter]] that causes it to experience a [[Force]] when placed in an [[Electromagnetic Field]]. Electric charge can be positive or negative. Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. An object with no net charge is referred to as electrically neutral.

# Electric Monopoles
**Isolated Electric Charges** are carried by [[Subatomic Particles]]. In ordinary matter, negative charge is carried by [[Electron|Electrons]], and positive charge is carried by the [[Proton|Protons]] in the nuclei of atoms. If there are more electrons than protons in a piece of [[Matter]], it will have a negative charge, if there are fewer it will have a positive charge, and if there are equal numbers it will be neutral. 

> [!HELP] Magnetic Analog
> Due to the current lack of evidence for [[Magnetic Charge (g)|Magnetic Monopoles]], there is not a real analog for the isolated electric charges that exist within electricity. 

[[Electric Charge (q)|Electric Charge]] is quantized: it comes in integer multiples of individual small units called the [[Elementary Electric Charge (e)]], about $1.602×10^{−19}$ $C$, which is the smallest charge that can exist freely.
