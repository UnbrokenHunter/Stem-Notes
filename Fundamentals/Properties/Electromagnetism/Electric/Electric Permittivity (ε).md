# Definition
Permittivity measures how easily an [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]] can penetrate and [[Polarization (Matter)|Polarize]] a medium. It relates the electric field $\vec{E}$ to the electric displacement $\vec{D}$. In [[Vacuum]], it is a constant, called the [[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)|Permittivity of Free Space]]. There is also a measurement [[Relative Electric Permittivity (εr)]], that compares the permittivity to the [[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)|Vacuum Permittivity]], giving a new value that is often called the [[Relative Electric Permittivity (εr)|Dielectric Constant]]. 

> [!HELP] Magnetic Analog
> The magnetic analog for [[Electric Permittivity (ε)|Electric Permittivity]] is [[Magnetic Permeability (μ)|Magnetic Permeability]]

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Electric permittivity is measured in **farads per meter (F/m)**.

## Formula 
$$
\epsilon \equiv \epsilon_{0}(1+\chi_{e}) = \varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon _{r} 
$$
Where
- $\epsilon$ is the [[Electric Permittivity (ε)|Permittivity]] of the Medium
- $\epsilon_{0}$ is the [[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)]]
- $\chi _e$ is the [[Electric Susceptibility (χₑ)|Electric Susceptibility]]
- $\varepsilon_r$ is the [[Relative Electric Permittivity (εr)]]

Or relating $\vec{E}$ to $\vec{D}$:
$$
\vec{D} = \varepsilon \vec{E}
$$
