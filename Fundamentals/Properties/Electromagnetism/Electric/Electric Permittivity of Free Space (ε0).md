# Definition
 Vacuum permittivity, commonly denoted $\epsilon_{0}$ is the value of the absolute [[Dielectric]] [[Electric Permittivity (ε)|Permittivity]] of classical [[Vacuum]]. It may also be referred to as the **Permittivity of Free Space**, the electric constant, or the distributed [[Capacitance]] of the vacuum. 
 
> [!NOTE] Constant Value!
> The value of this [[Constant]] is $\varepsilon_{0} =8.8541878188(14)×10^{−12} \text{ } F⋅m^{−1}$
 
 It is an ideal physical [[Constant]]. Its [[Committee on Data of the International Science Council|CODATA]] value is $\epsilon_{0} =8.8541878188(14)×10^{−12} \text{ } F⋅m^{−1}$ It is a measure of how dense of an [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]] is "permitted" to form in response to [[Electric Charge (q)]] and relates the units for electric charge to mechanical quantities such as length and [[Force]].

## Formula
$$
\varepsilon_{r} = \frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_{0}} = 1+\chi_{e}
$$

> [!NOTE] Unit!  
> $\varepsilon_0$ has units of **farads per meter (F/m)**.
