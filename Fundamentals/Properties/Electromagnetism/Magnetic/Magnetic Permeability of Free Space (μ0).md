# Definition
**Magnetic permeability of free space** ($\mu_0$) — also called the **permeability of vacuum** — is a **fundamental physical [[Constant]]** that defines the strength of the magnetic interaction in a vacuum. 

> [!HELP] Electric Analog
> It is the magnetic analog of [[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)]]. 

> [!NOTE] Constant Value!
> $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}\ \text{H/m}$

## Formula
The permeability of vacuum relates to the **permittivity of free space** ($\varepsilon_0$) and the **speed of light** ($c$) by:
$$
c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0}}
$$
Where:
- $c$ is the [[Speed of Light (c)|Speed of Light]]
- $\mu_{0}$ is the [[Magnetic Permeability of Free Space (μ0)|Permeability of Free Space]]
- $\varepsilon_0$ is the [[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)|Permittivity of Free Space]]

and forms the baseline for [[Relative Permeability]]:
$$
\mu = \mu_r \mu_0
$$
