# Definition
**Magnetic permeability** ($\mu$) measures how easily a material supports the formation of a **[[Magnetic Field (B)|Magnetic B-Field]]** within it. It defines the relationship between the **[[Magnetic Field (B)|Magnetic Flux Density]]** ($\vec{B}$) and the **[[Magnetic Field (H)|Magnetic Field Intensity]]** ($\vec{H}$).

> [!HELP] Electric Analog
> The electric analog for [[Magnetic Permeability (μ)|Magnetic Permeability]] is [[Electric Permittivity (ε)|Electric Permittivity]]

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Magnetic permeability is measured in **henries per meter (H/m)**.

## Formula
$$
\vec{B} = \mu \vec{H}
$$
Where  
- $\vec{B}$ is the **[[Magnetic Field (B)|Magnetic Flux Density]]** (T)  
- $\mu$ is the **[[Magnetic Permeability (μ)|Magnetic Permeability]]** (H/m)  
- $\vec{H}$ is the **[[Magnetic Field (H)|Magnetic Field Intensity]]** (A/m)

Relation to susceptibility:
$$
\mu = \mu_0 (1 + \chi_m)
$$
Where  
- $\mu$ is the [[Magnetic Permeability of Free Space (μ0)|Permeability of Free Space]] of the medium  
- $\mu_0$ is the [[[Magnetic Permeability of Free Space|Permeability of Free Space]]
- $\chi_m$ is the [[Magnetic Susceptibility (χm)|Magnetic Susceptibility]]
and the **relative permeability**:
$$
\mu_r = \frac{\mu}{\mu_0} = 1 + \chi_m
$$
