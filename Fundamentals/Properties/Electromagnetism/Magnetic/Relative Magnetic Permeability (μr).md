# Definition
**Relative Magnetic Permeability** ($\mu_r$) describes how a material’s [[Magnetic Response]] compares to that of free space:

$$
\mu_r = \frac{\mu}{\mu_0} = 1 + \chi_m
$$

It expresses how much stronger (or weaker) the [[Magnetic Field (B)|Magnetic Flux Density]] is inside the material than in [[Vacuum]].

> The electric analog is [[Relative Electric Permittivity (εr)|Relative Permittivity]].

> [!NOTE] Unit!  
> Relative permeability is **dimensionless**.
