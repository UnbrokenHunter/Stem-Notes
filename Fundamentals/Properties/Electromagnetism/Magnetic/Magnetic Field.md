# Definition
Magnetic fields are produced by moving [[Electric Charge (q)|Electric Charge]] and the intrinsic [[Magnetization (M)]] of [[Elementary Particles]] associated with a fundamental quantum property, their [[Spin]].  Magnetic fields and [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]] are interrelated and are both components of the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature.

In Electromagnetics, the term magnetic field is used for two distinct but closely related vector fields denoted by the symbols [[Magnetic Field (B)|B]] and [[Magnetic Field (H)|H]]. [[Magnetic Field (H)|H]] is **induced** in the space around moving charge. [[Magnetic Field (B)|B]] is caused by the magnetic properties of matter where H exists.

### Two Meanings
B and H differ in how they take the medium and/or magnetization into account. In [[Vacuum]], the two fields are related through the [[Vacuum Permeability]], $\frac{B}{\mu_{0}}=H$ in a magnetized material, the quantities on each side of this equation differ by the magnetization field of the [[Material]].
