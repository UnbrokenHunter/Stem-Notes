# Definition
The **Magnetic Field Vector** (**B**) at any point can be defined as the vector that, when used in the [[Lorentz Force Law]], correctly predicts the [[Force]] on a [[Charged Particle]] at that point. 

> [!HELP] Electric Analog
> The B-Field is the magnetic analog for [[Electric Displacement Field (D)|Electric Flux Density]]. 

> [!NOTE] Units!
> The unit of B, [[Magnetic Field (B)|Magnetic Flux Density]], is the **tesla** (in SI base units: **kilogram per second squared per ampere** $\frac{kg}{As^{2}}$)â€Š which is equivalent to newton per meter per ampere ($\frac{N}{mA}$). 

## Formula
The [[Magnetic Field (B)|B-Field]] is calculated using the [[Lorentz Force Law]]: 

![[Lorentz Force Law#Formula]]

The direction of force on the charge can be determined by a mnemonic known as the [[Right-Hand Rule]]. Using the right hand, pointing the thumb in the direction of the current, and the fingers in the direction of the [[Magnetic Field (B)|Magnetic Field]], the resulting [[Force]] on the charge points outwards from the palm. The force on a negatively [[Charged Particle]] is in the opposite direction. If both the [[Speed]] and the [[Electric Charge (q)|Charge]] are reversed then the direction of the [[Force]] remains the same. For that reason a magnetic field measurement (by itself) cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left. (Both of these cases produce the same [[Current]].) On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric field can distinguish between these.
