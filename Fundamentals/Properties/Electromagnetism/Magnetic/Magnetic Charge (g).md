### # Definition
A **[[Magnetic Charge (g)]]** is a hypothetical [[Particle]] that carries an isolated **[[Magnetic Charge (g)]]**. It would produce a [[Magnetic field]] with lines radiating outward or inward from a point, like the Coulomb field of an electric charge:

> [!HELP] Electric Analog
> This **hypothetical** particle would be analogous to [[Electric Charge (q)|Electric Charge]]  if it were discovered.  

$$
\vec{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}g}{4\pi r^2}\hat{r}
$$
Where:
- $\vec{B}$ is the [[Magnetic Field (B)|Magnetic B-Field]]
- $\mu_{0}$ is the [[Magnetic Permeability of Free Space (μ0)|Permeability of Free Space]]
- $g$ is the [[Magnetic Charge (g)|Magnetic Charge]]
- $r$ is the [[Distance]] from the monopole
- $\hat{r}$ is the [[Radial Unit Vector]] pointing away from the monopole

> [!NOTE] No Experimental Evidence  
> Despite extensive searches, no magnetic monopoles have ever been observed. All known magnetic fields are produced by **dipoles** — pairs of north and south poles — or by moving electric charges (currents).
