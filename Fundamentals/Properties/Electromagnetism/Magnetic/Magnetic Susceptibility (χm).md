# Definition
**Magnetic susceptibility** ($\chi_m$) quantifies how much a material becomes **[[Magnetization (M)|Magnetized]]** when placed in an external [[Magnetic field]]. It shows whether the material is **attracted** (paramagnetic/ferromagnetic) or **repelled** (diamagnetic) by the field. 

> [!HELP] Electric Analog
> [[Magnetic Susceptibility (χm)|Magnetic Susceptibility]] is the magnetic analog to [[Electric Susceptibility (χₑ)]]. 
> 

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Magnetic susceptibility is **dimensionless**.

**Related:**  
- [[Magnetization (M)]]  
- [[Magnetic Permeability (μ)]]  
- [[Diamagnetic]]  
- [[Paramagnetic]]  
- [[Ferromagnetic]]

## Formula
$$
\vec{M} = \chi_m \vec{H}
$$
Where  
- $\vec{M}$ is the **[[Magnetization (M)|Magnetization]]** (A/m)  
- $\chi_m$ is the **[[Magnetic Susceptibility (χm)|Magnetic Susceptibility]]** (dimensionless)  
- $\vec{H}$ is the **[[Magnetic Field (H)|Magnetic Field Intensity (H)]]** (A/m)

Relationship to **permeability**:
$$
\mu = \mu_0 (1 + \chi_m)
$$
Where $\mu_0$ is the **[[Magnetic Permeability of Free Space (μ0)]]**.
