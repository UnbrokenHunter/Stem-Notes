# Definition
The [[Magnetic Field (H)|H-Field]] represents the portion of the [[Magnetic Field]] produced by [[Free Currents]] (external currents) and is useful when separating material response. H is defined so that it relates to free current via [[Ampère’s Law in Magnetostatics]] (units: ampere per meter, $\frac{A}{m}$).

> [!HELP] Electric Analog
> The [[Magnetic Field (H)|H-Field]] is the magnetic analog for the [[Electric Field (E)]]

> [!NOTE] Units!
> The SI unit of the [[Magnetic Field (H)|H-Field]] is the ampere per meter ($\frac{A}{m}$), and the CGS unit is the oersted (Oe) 

## Formula
The [[Magnetic Field (H)|Magnetic H-Field]] is defined as:
$$
\vec{H} \equiv \frac{1}{\mu_{0}}\vec{B} - \vec{M}
$$
Where: 
- $\vec{H}$ is the [[Magnetic Field (H)|H-Field]]
- $\mu_{0}$ is the [[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)]] 
- $\vec{M}$ is the [[Magnetization (M)]]
- $\vec{B}$ is the [[Magnetic Field (B)|B-Field]]

In a [[Vacuum]], [[Magnetic Field (B)|B]] and [[Magnetic Field (H)|H]] are proportional to each other. Inside a material they are different.
