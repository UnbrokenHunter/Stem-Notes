# Dirac Quantization Condition

In [[1931]], **[[Paul Dirac]]** showed that if even a _single_ [[Magnetic Charge (g)|Magnetic Monopole]] existed, it would imply that **[[Electric Charge (q)|Electric Charge]] must be quantized**.

## Formula
$$
eg=n \frac{h}{2}
$$
Where:
- $e$ is the [[Elementary Electric Charge (e)|Elementary Electric Charge]],
- $g$ is the [[Elementary Magnetic Charge (gD)|Elementary Magnetic Charge]],
- $n$ is the integer
- $h$ is [[Planck’s Constant]].
This is known as the **Dirac charge quantization condition**.

> [!QUOTE] Meaning of the integer $n$
> The integer $n$ ensures that the phase difference around a monopole loop equals an integer multiple of $2\pi$.
> It’s the topological winding number — essentially “how many times” the wavefunction wraps around the monopole’s vector potential in configuration space.
> So physically:
> - $n=1$ corresponds to the smallest possible magnetic charge (the “Dirac quantum of charge”).
> - $n=2, 3, …$ correspond to integer multiples of that charge (like 2×, 3× monopoles).

## Magnetic Charge
It predicts a “unit” of [[Magnetic Charge (g)|Magnetic Charge]] (the **Dirac charge quantum**):
$$
g_{D} = \frac{h}{2e} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \text{ Wb}
$$
This would imply an **enormous** charge compared to $e$, meaning monopoles would interact _very strongly_ with [[Electromagnetic Field|Electromagnetic Fields]] — which partly explains why they’d be rare or confined.

### Theoretical Context
- Appear in certain **[[Grand Unified Theories]] (GUTs)** and **[[String Theory|String Theories]]** as [[Topology|Topological]] [[Solitons]].
- Could explain **charge [[Quantization]]** in nature.
- Some models suggest they might have formed in the **[[Early Universe]]**, but cosmic searches have not found any.
