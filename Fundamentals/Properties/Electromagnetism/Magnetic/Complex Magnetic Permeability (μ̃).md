# Definition
**Complex Magnetic Permeability** ($\tilde{\mu}$) generalizes permeability to account for **energy storage** and **magnetic loss** in alternating or high-frequency magnetic fields.

$$
\tilde{\mu} = \mu' - i\mu''
$$

Where  
- $\mu'$ — real part (magnetic energy storage; inductive response)  
- $\mu''$ — imaginary part (magnetic loss; hysteresis, eddy currents)

### Physical Meaning
- **Real part ($\mu'$):** How easily the medium magnetizes (stores magnetic energy).  
- **Imaginary part ($\mu''$):** How much magnetic energy is dissipated as heat.

### Relation to Complex Permittivity
Both $\tilde{\varepsilon}$ and $\tilde{\mu}$ share the same form:

$$
\tilde{\varepsilon} = \varepsilon' - i\varepsilon'', \quad \tilde{\mu} = \mu' - i\mu''
$$

and both determine the **Complex Refractive Index**:

$$
\tilde{n} = \sqrt{\tilde{\varepsilon}_r \tilde{\mu}_r}
$$
