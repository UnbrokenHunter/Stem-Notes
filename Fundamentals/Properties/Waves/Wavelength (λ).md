# In Light
In Physics, wavelength refers to the distance between crests of a light wave. 
## Formula 
It can be related to [[Frequency (ƒ)]] ($f$) using the formula: $$c=\lambda f$$Where:
- $c$ is the [[Speed of Light (c)]]
- $f$ is the [[Frequency (ƒ)|Frequency]]
- $\lambda$ is the [[Wavelength (λ)|Wavelength]]
