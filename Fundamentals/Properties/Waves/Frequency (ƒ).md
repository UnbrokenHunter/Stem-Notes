# In Light
In Physics, frequency refers to the number of times a light wave oscillates per second. 

## Formula 
It can be related to [[Wavelength (λ)]] ($\lambda$) using the formula: $$c=\lambda f$$Where:
- $c$ is the [[Speed of Light (c)]]
- $f$ is the [[Frequency (ƒ)|Frequency]]
- $\lambda$ is the [[Wavelength (λ)|Wavelength]]
