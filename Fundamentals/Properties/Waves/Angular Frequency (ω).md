# Definition
The **Angular Frequency** is the number of oscillations in radians per second ($\frac{rad}{\sec}$). While [[Frequency (ƒ)|Frequency]] is often more intuitive, the angular frequency usually makes the math work out nicer.
## Formula 
It is related to [[Frequency (ƒ)]] like this:
$$
\omega =2\pi f
$$
Where:
- $f$ is the [[Frequency (ƒ)|Frequency]]
- $\omega$ is the [[Angular Frequency (ω)|Angular Frequency]]


# Natural Angular Frequency
The **Natural Angular Frequency** $\omega_{0}$ is a specific type of [[Angular Frequency (ω)|Angular Frequency]].
