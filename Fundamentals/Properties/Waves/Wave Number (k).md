# Definition
**Wave number**, also known as **spatial frequency** an **Inverse Wavelength** represents the **number of wave cycles per unit distance**. It defines how rapidly a wave oscillates in space and is related to [[Wavelength (λ)]] and [[Angular Frequency (ω)]].

> [!NOTE] Unit!
> Wave number ($k$) is measured in **radians per meter (rad/m)**.

**Related:**  
- [[Angular Frequency (ω)]]  
- [[Wavelength (λ)]]  
- [[Frequency (ƒ)]]  
- [[Speed of Light (c)]]

## Formula
$$
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
$$
Where  
- $k$ is the **[[Wave Number (k)|Wave Number]]** (rad/m)  
- $\lambda$ is the **[[Wavelength (λ)|Wavelength]]** (m)

Connection to angular frequency:
$$
\omega = v k
$$
Where  
- $\omega$ is the **[[Angular Frequency (ω)|Angular Frequency]]** (rad/s)  
- $v$ is the **[[Phase Velocity]]** of the wave (m/s)
