# Definition
Young's Modulus is a mechanical property of solid materials that measures the tensile or compressive [[Stiffness]] when the force is applied lengthwise. It is the [[Elastic Modulus]] for [[Tension]] or axial [[Compression]]. Young's modulus is defined as the ratio of the [[Stress]] (force per unit area) applied to the object and the resulting axial [[Strain]] (a dimensionless quantity that quantifies relative deformation) in the [[Linear Elastic]] region of the material. As such, Young's modulus is similar to and proportional to the spring constant in [[Hooke's law]], but with dimensions of pressure instead of force per distance.
## Formula
You can calculate Young's Modulus (E) using the formula
$$
\sigma=E\varepsilon
$$
Where:
- $E$ is the [[Young's Modulus]]
- $\sigma$ is the [[Stress]]
- $\varepsilon$ is the [[Strain]]
