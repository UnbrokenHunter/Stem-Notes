# Definition
Fundamentally, the [[Maxwell-Faraday Equation]] tells us that the way a [[Magnetic Field (B)|Magnetic Field]] changes over [[Time]], depends on the [[Curl Operator|Curl]] of it's [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]]. 


## Formula 
$$
\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}
$$
Where: 
- $\nabla$ is the [[Gradient]] Operator
- $\times$ is the [[Curl Operator]]
- $\vec{E}$ is the [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]]
- $\partial \vec{B}$ is the Change in the [[Magnetic Field (B)|Magnetic Field]]
- $\partial t$ is the [[Time]]
