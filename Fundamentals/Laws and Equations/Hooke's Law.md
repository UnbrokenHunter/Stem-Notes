# Definition
Hooke's law states that the force $F$ required to stretch or compress a spring by some distance $x$ is proportional to that distance, given by the formula $F=-kx$, where $k$ is the [[Spring Constant (k)|Spring Constant]]. This principle applies as long as the material remains within its elastic limit; beyond this point, the material may deform permanently. The law is foundational in physics and engineering, and practical applications include spring scales and mechanical clocks

## Formula
$$
F = -kx
$$
Where:
- $F$ is the [[Force]] required to stretch or compress a [[Spring]] by a distance. 
- $k$ is the [[Spring Constant (k)]]
- $x$ is the distance it is moved
