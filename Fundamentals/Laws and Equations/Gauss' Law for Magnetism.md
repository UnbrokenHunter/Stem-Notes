# Definition
Fundamentally, [[Gauss' Law for Magnetism]] tells us that the [[Divergence Operator|Divergence]] of [[Magnetic Field (B)]] is $0$ everywhere. A more intuitive way to think about this is that if a [[Magnetic Field (B)|Magnetic Field]] were a fluid, it would be incompressible, with no "sources" and no "sinks," just like water. 

This also has the implication that [[Magnetic Charge (g)|Magnetic Charge]] are impossible. As far as we are aware, it is impossible to have a single pole in isolation, without it's companion, unlike isolated positive and negative [[Electric Charge (q)|Electric Charge]]. 

> [!Note] 
> A Monopole is a hypothetical object that would act in isolation, like a single pole, either North or South. It would be the hypothetical equivalent to positive and negative charges in an [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]]. 

## Formula
$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0
$$
Where:
- $\nabla$ is the [[Gradient]] Operator
- $\cdot$ is the [[Divergence Operator]]
- $\vec{B}$ is the [[Magnetic Field (B)|B-Field]] or [[Magnetic Field (B)|Magnetic Flux Density]] or [[Magnetic Field (B)|Magnetic Induction]] (T, tesla)
