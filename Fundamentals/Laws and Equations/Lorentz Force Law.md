F=qE+q(v\times B)
$$
Where:
- $F$ is the [[Force]] on the [[Charged Particle]]
- $q$ is the Particle's [[Electric Charge (q)|Charge]]
- $E$ is the [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]] 
- $\vec{v}$ is the Particle's [[Velocity]]
- $\times$ Is the [[Cross Products]] Operator
- $\vec{B}$ is the [[Magnetic Field (B)|Magnetic Field]]
