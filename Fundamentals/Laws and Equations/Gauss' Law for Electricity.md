# Definition
Fundamentally, [[Gauss' Law for Electricity|Gauss' Law]] tells us that the [[Divergence Operator|Divergence]] of an [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]] is proportional to the [[Volume Charge Density (ρ)|Charge Density]] at that point. ![[image.png]]
A way to imagine what that looks like is to think of positively charged regions as "sources" of some imagined electric fluid, and negatively charged regions as "sinks." In regions of space where there is no charge, the fluid would be flowing incompressible, just like water.
## Formula
$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{D} = \rho \quad \text{or (in free space)} \quad \nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
$$
Where:
- $\nabla$ is the [[Gradient]] Operator
- $\cdot$ is the [[Divergence Operator]]
- $\vec{D}$ is the [[Electric Displacement Field (D)|Electric Displacement Field]]
- $\rho$ is the [[Volume Charge Density (ρ)|Volume Charge Density]]
- $\vec{E}$ is the [[Electric Field (E)|Electric Field]]
- $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the [[Electric Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)]]
