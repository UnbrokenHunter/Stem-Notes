The special qualities of the human voice lie — in part — in the precise control of [[Pitch]] that is given by the vocal chords, combined with flexability of the cavieites of the mouth, nose, and throat which are used to impose variable formant characteristics on the sounds already produced. 
These [[Formant]] characteristics, based on cavity [[Resonator|Resonance]], are responsible for vowel sounds and so make an important contribution to the intelligiblity of speech. Most of this varibility is expressed between 200 and 2700 Hz, the range of telephone transmission. 
Other characteristics of speech include sibilantss and stops of various kinds, which, together with the [[Formant]] [[Resonator|Resonances]], provide all that is needed for high intellibility. These extend the range to about 8000  Hz. A whisper, in which the vocal coords are not used, may be perfectly clear and understandable. 
The [[Vibration|Vibrations]] produced by the vocal chords, further character, and the ability to produce song. For normal speech the fundamental varies over a range of about twelve tones, and is centered somewhere near 145 Hz for a man and 230 Hz for a woman. As the formant regons differ little, the female voice therefore has less harmonics in the regions of stronger resonance; so its quality may be thinner (or purer) than a man's voice. For song, the fundamental range of most voices is about two octaves — though, exceptionally, it can be much greater. 

### Microphones for Speech
For a [[Microphone]], and other sound equipment that can cope with orchestral music, the human voice produces no problems of frequency range, nor of volume except for the [[Plosive]] "p" that can blow a [[Diaphragm]] beyond its normal working range when some people talk directly into it. 
As we shall see, the demands of intelligibility require that there must be less indirect (reverberant) sound than for musical [[Instrument|Instruments]]; and this in turn may create further problems due to working close to a directional [[Microphone]]. But apart from this the main question with [[Microphone|Microphones]] for speech is whether a very wide frequency range is desirable : this adds not only to the cost of the [[Microphone]] but also to the noise picked up at the extreme ends of the range. 
Some intelligibility is improved by using a microphone with a peak (a stronger response) in the 6000-8000 Hz frequency range. Some older or cheaper microphones have this anyway. But this may also enhance the natural sibilance of some voices.
